            <h3>You can find my github page <a href="https://github.com/Jean-Oosthuizen/Jean-Oosthuizen.github.io">here</a>.</h3>

            A number guessing game. You enter a 4 digit number ranging from 0000 to 9999, and the program
            outputs a hint telling you whether the number is too big or too small.

        <p>
            This page will seemingly invert your mouse controls! Use your inverted mouse to click on the "free 
            robux and gems" image, and chase it around in desperation. Getting back to this page may be slightly tricky,
            but it shouldn't take too long to figure out!
